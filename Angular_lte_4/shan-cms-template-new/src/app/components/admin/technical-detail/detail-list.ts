        <ul><li><p><strong>May 2023 - mid to end</strong>, began introducing a 'category' layer in the menus.<br/>
        - The number of menus has become large and the right nav bar has had to have scrolling introduced.<br/>
        - Each menu record has a new field called 'tab' which is the name of a category in a many (menu) to one (category) mapping<br/>
        - The categories would simulate a tabbed look
        - When clicking a category, the 'leaf' menus would show - ONLY those menus grouped under this category<br/>
        - renamed SideNavBarComponent to TopNavBarComponent.. included in the tabbing control TabbingContainerComponent<br/>
        - (will use this for now for above, attempt top make 'ThemeNav' flexible, but that is likely to be low priority()   </p></li>

       <li>These Arrays are stored in data lists - typescript files, as , imported into the relevant component file and subsequently rendered<br/>
          (These typescript files content is exposed and exported as a class with a contexy relevant name)</li>
       <li>A list of the different themes including special lists is maintained; here the date uploaded is updated for that theme reference in this list.</li>
       <li>The source is saved, built and published to Google firebase (as on June 12, 2023)</li>

       <li>b. Typical data process steps:</li>
       <li>b. i.   When the sketch is ready, it is scanned or photographed into a jpeg which is ultimately saved into the downloads folder</li>
       <li>b. ii.  This downloaded image file is appropriately named (theme and date) and then moved to the appropriate folder as per the above(Point 4.)</li>
       <li>b. iii. Information on the sketch - image name with relative path, and other demographics like description, rating, date compleyed and uploaded is 
               entered as a JSON object into the corresponding data list file (manifest -??) as per 5. and 6. above </li>
       <li>b. iv.  The list specified in 8.above is updated</li>
       <li>b. v.   PERIODICALLY a new theme is generated - this involves adding a new data list, a new image folder, new entry in the index list and also 
               importing and refering the new list in the service class</li>
       <li>b. vi. The physical sketch is added to an album 'scrap book' with plastic pockets, and a one line description is added to a text file.</li>
       <li>b. vii. Once the album is filled up, the text file is printed and inserted in the back of the cover page</li>
       <li> c.<strong>As of July 10 2023, automation functionality is more or less achieved<br/>
                <ol><li> items 'b ii' - the move through 'b iv' automated</li>
                    <li> One line descriptor for items 'b vi - vii' entry into a single text dump file, from which it can be cut and pasted into the correct list</li>

        <blockquote>The emphasis as upto mid 2023 was to get a website with clear rendition of my sketches, with some basic structuring and inoffensive, plain styling. 
        Over time, the structuring has become increasingly unweildy, the data has increased <em>significantly</em><.<br/>
        From filling out the cracks, to leveling bumps, to give this gallery a new new look and feel, there are also some undeniable 'medium priority bugs', 
        some features to add, etc</blockquote>
      
        <ul>

        - To filter some pages based on user role. avoiding 'TMI' for some users, keeping some views visible for interested parties,<br/>
        - Current implementation is for 'admin' and 'non admin' where this view is reachable only for the former role<br/>
        - Using authguard/CanActivate, with hard coded users 'shantanu', 'technician' and 'admin', roles 'ADMIN' and 'TECHNICAL'<br/>
        - I'd probably 'mask' some themes from some user roles..<br/>
        - right now, some logical errors connected with technician
        </li>
        <li>Some logical and other errors<br/> 
        - Sometimes this loads in card mode<br/>
        - The 'Technical' view may not be reached<br/>
        - Visibility of the newly added tabbing buttons at the header<br/>
        - Using indexing on this page instead of the master detail - probably correct application of blocking event emission/bubbling
        - others<br/>
        - ...<br/></li>
        <li>Automation of load (see 'To Dos Automation')</li>
        <li>Styling, positioning, etc: reduction of mutiple scroll bars as much as can be done, trying to keep content visible and responsive, contemporary look and feel, etc
