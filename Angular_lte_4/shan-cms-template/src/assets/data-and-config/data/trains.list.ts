        This train was started in 1964 as a fast between New Delhi and Agra. Typically one woould buy a tourist package - take this train from Delhi in the morning, detrain at Agra and get onto a day tour of the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri and other tourist spots (Lunch included), then take the return back to Delhi late evening.
It was pulled by Steam locomotives (probably) for a long time even after Diesel and Electric power was at hand on this route, as a sort of tradition
