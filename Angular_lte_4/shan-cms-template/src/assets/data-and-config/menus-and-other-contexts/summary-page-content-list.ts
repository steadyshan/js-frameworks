    `<H1>A Journey of Sketches</H1>
      <p>
          <em> <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I always have liked to draw."</h6></em><br/>
          Some things just stick in memory. I remember, when I was a kid, my father drawing me a plane. It was a pretty good drawing...
          I dont remember the circumstances, but that was what set me off. My brother and I always loved trains 
          (our family has had this perpetual love story with Indian Railways) and I had always been fascinated with aircraft. 
          Drop in liking for World War 2 stories and Commando comics, making for themes involving anything to do with modes of transport = 
          from dogfights to train yards, the occasional ship and tank, sailing ship, ocean liner.. 

      </p>
      <p> .. AND the occasional human face and figure...</p> 
      <p> <strong>Fast foward to Q3 2020...</strong><br/><em>We were caught up in the grip of
      the COVID 19 Pandemic - <ul><li>Work remotely, blurring and fragmentation of work and non work times</li>
      <li>Social and people to people restrictions and, as a side effect, no outdoor/away from home event or entertainment</li>
      <li>Re-invention, application of imagination, finding means to stave off boredome, insanity and getting on each others nerves ,</li>
      <li>..... And as a result ---- <strong>SKETCHING</strong></li></ul></p>
      <p>Presenting humbly, my collection of sketches..<br>With time, attitudes, priorities, nature, liking and many other aspects change... <br/>This, I guess is pretty much reflected in the content here
      </br>Hope you will like them</p>

      <p><em> <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before plunging into this sea of verbosity, </strong> a few things
      <br/>- This passage is built off of my other website, written somewhere in the mid 2010s.. 
      <br/>- As of June 2021, I will have inserted, deleted, modified text below; made typo-, grammar and spelling corrections.
      <br/>- Styling not carried over as some other things...)</em></p>
      <p>"And Alexander wept because he had no more lands to conquer".</p>
      <p>Sound profound? Makes me seem like someone who gets philosophical? 
        <br/>... Kind of, No... because these are words which  <em>Hans Gruber</em> (the late Alan Rickman) speaks before he does away with <em>Joseph Takagi</em> of Nakatomi corp in the movie <em>Die Hard</em>, one of my favorites and which I have just begun to tire of seeing repeatedly.

          In truth, it applies to today's world in both a good and not so good sense:
          <br/>The world around is changing. We have access to more and more of stuff, more stuff to see, eat, buy and to do. We cant complain of boredom; we have no right to weep.
          <br/>That said, it is because the world is changing so rapidly especially in the field I am in - IT - there is also the need to stay with or ahead of the game. 
          Dad used to go to work at 9:00 AM do a lot of the same thing over and over again

          at his office, then come home by 6:00 pm. Do nothing on the weekend.
          <br/>It's changed now. A year and a half  ago I was doing sql server maintenance, writing web services in microsoft technologies and writing layered web apps. Today I am angular front end guy doing single page stuff using  somethinng they call MV*., Tomorrow I could be writing mark up and styling that does everything in the html layer... Or learn python for machine learning to join (Cyberdyne systems)...<br/> I lag behind and a horde of yuppies and puppies are there to take my

          place. Scary? Can be, sometimes. Fun? RIGHT!!!

      <p>At the end of the day, mate, it's Attitude. Intuition, innvoation and imagination and how (well) you apply to the right situation.</p>

        <em>Also, Teamwork:</em><br/>I remember the last working day of a recent year. The day for roll out to <em>Production</em>. Was supposed to be a formality.
      <br />The Team was all in by 10:00 AM and we were supposed to wish each other and leave by 12:00 PM. We'd just ended a

          roller coaster of a developer cycle ride seeing the target move so many times as we raised our guns, yet managed to stick to our commited deadline. We were already patting ourselves on the back.
      </p>
      <p>
          We finally left at 6:00 PM that day, the last in the building to leave(The security guy passed our room 4 -5 times, trying not to look too curious..).
        <br/> What happened in between is a test of how one should be street smart and how the team worked and stood together.
        <br/>
          A new batch of data just came in for our happy path testing. <br/><em>Catch</em>: this data had lot of missing values, lot of missing fields (as well!). Stuff breaking. breaking. breaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing <em>'{{....}}'</em> instead of text on the browser all over.
          <br/> Our fault at

          (lack of) defensive programming? Probably. Then what about the previous batches which never had this?
        </p>
        <p>
      Our management was panicking, arguments were flying back and forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;Non seasonal jargon was threatening to enter the roon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Coffee cups were forning a pile, peoples breath were of burnt tobacco...<br/>&nbsp; At the same time, some of us were putting our heads down, innovating, cutting

          corners, shoring up our code. I was in the enviable position of the front end where the fixes would show and impress.<br/> I was also part of that last group. With the higher ups about to make a decision, I stopped all, and projected my local version of the

          app UI (with the new data) unit tested, unit regression tested. Jaws dropped. Realization of the fact that this was being fixed sunk in across the war room. Then the enthusiasm, the fire and the energy returned. Tested again

          thoroughly.</p> <p>Handed over before EOD as promised. <em>Happy Ending</em></p>
